## Admin Features

- **Authentication:** Admin login functionality handled by Clerk.
- **CRUD Operations:** Admins can create, read, update, and delete finance details.
- **Dashboard:** The dashboard displays a table using React Table, showing finance details and allowing CRUD operations.

## User Features

- **View Items:** Users can view a list of items.
- **Item Details:** Users can view detailed information about each item.
- **Interaction:** Users can interact with items by adding, updating, or deleting the items in the list.

## Deployment

- **Access Information:** A link to the working environment is provided, with credentials to access the admin and user interfaces if needed.

This project serves as a prototype to demonstrate my skills in building full-stack applications with Node.js and React.
